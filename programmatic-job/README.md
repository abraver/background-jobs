# Programmatic background jobs

While background jobs are best suited for one-off, ad-hoc usage, there are times
when it is beneficial to programatically orchestrate background jobs. Local and
Launcher jobs can be programatically handled with functions in the [`rstudioapi`
package ](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudioapi). The examples here use the same
`estimate-pi.R` script as the [simulation example](../simulation-job).

## Local Jobs
Local jobs can be started using `rstudioapi::jobRunScript()`. An example of this
pattern is found in [`local-jobs.R`](local-jobs.R).

## Launcher Jobs
Launcher jobs can be more flexible than local jobs. The
`rstudioapi::launcherSubmitJob()` function is can be used to launch specific R
commands or scripts as Launcher jobs. An example of this pattern is found in
[`launcher-jobs.R`](launcher-jobs.R).

## Output
Both the local and Launcher examples illustrated here save output to the
`output/` directory. The [`analyze-output`](analyze-output.Rmd) notebook
contains code to analyze and visualize the output files generated by the jobs.
