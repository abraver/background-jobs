# Ames Models

This example builds a collection of random forest models built around the Ames
housing dataset. The models are built using functions from the
[`tidymodels`](https://github.com/tidymodels) package and follow the example
described
[here](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/articles/Applications/Recipes_and_rsample.html).
This job is suitable to be run as either a local or Launcher background job.
